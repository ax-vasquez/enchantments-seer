Hate the default enchanting experience? Us too. This mod adds a new way to enchant items that doesn't lead to absurdly-high
experience costs while shifting the "responsibility" to crafting the reagents rather than consuming player experience.

Experience is still consumed, but at a much smaller rate than the default enchanting process.
