# `api` README

The API package provides code intended for use both within the mod itself, and within mods that may use this mod as 
a dependency. The idea is that other modders can use the classes, interfaces, enums, etc. defined in this package to
either extend functionality provided by the code in `api`, or simply use it to more-easily integrate with the Enchantments
Seer mod.

**It should be noted that this package only exists to conform to the design pattern employed by Mekanism.** Enchantments
Seer was not designed with extensibility in mind (though, there is no reason why we can't).
